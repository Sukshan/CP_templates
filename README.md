# templates

Competative Programming demands quick implementation. 
Its is optimal to spend more time on thinking and building a correct solution and less on actual implementing what is 
then in your head.

Templates help you save time in writing the same basic framework of some algorithm which is being used in some particular scenario and then modify 
it accordingly as per the question.

Use templates only after you have practise some algorithm throughly and after gaining confidence of being able to implement it anywhere anytime without 
relying on templates.

I have made a collection of my personal templates which  I implemented them in my own style and which suits my use cases.
It is necessary that you make these on your own, it reflects you personal style and you always know the flow of logic in complex scenarios, whereas
using someone else's template will not be very helpful to you for faster learning and seamless implementation although you can always refer to others 
in cases.
