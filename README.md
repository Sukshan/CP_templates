# templates

Competative Programming demands quick implementation. 
Often there are 5 to 6 questions in a two hour contest starting from easiest to hardest.
Naturally, you would want to spend more time thinking about the solution and minimize the time it takes to implement it.
Sometimes, the first solution itself that you come up with will pass all testcases and will get accepted but many times, especially in regards to the tough questions, it takes multiple tries, multiple approaches to get right. So saving time on implementation gets very necessay. Getting stuck on implementation will lead to wastage of time and will also limit your ability to attempt the question multiple times with different approaches.

Templates help you save time. Prior writing  of basic framework of your code and also of some important, frequently used algorithms will lead to significant time saving.

Use algorithm templates only after you have practised that algorithm throughly and gained confidence.

I have made a collection of my personal templates. I have implemented them in my own style and to suits my use cases.
It is necessary that you first understand them properly and use them only when they make sense. That way, you would always know the logic beneath the code, and in cases when variation needs to be made to the original algorithm, you will not be limited by your lack of not knowing the internal workings of the template.
So, practice first, use my template generously and Happy coding.
